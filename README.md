A library for writing modern [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org/)-compatible multimodal journey planning applications using [React]() and [Redux]().

## Running the Example

An example of an OTP-RR application is included in the repository. The example project is a single page application with a root entry point of the `example.js` file. This example.js file can be modified to suit the needs of a particular implementation.

To run, first clone the repo and install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if needed.

Update `example-config.yml` with the needed API keys, and optionally, the OTP endpoint and initial map origin. (The default values are for a test server for Portland, OR.).

Install the dependencies and start a local instance using the following script:

```bash
yarn start
```

Should you want to maintain multiple configuration files, OTP-RR can be made to use a custom config file by using environment variables. Other environment variables also exist. `CUSTOM_CSS` can be used to point to a css file to inject, and `JS_CONFIG` can be used to point to a `config.js` file to override the one shipped with OTP-RR.

```bash
env YAML_CONFIG=/absolute/path/to/config.yml yarn start
```

## Deploying the UI

Build the js/css bundle by running `yarn build`. The build will appear in the `dist/` directory).

The same environment variables which affect the behavior of `yarn start` also affect `yarn build`. Running the following command builds OTP-RR with customized js and css:

```bash
env JS_CONFIG=my-custom-js.js CUSTOM_CSS=my-custom-css.css yarn build
```

## Internationalization

OTP-react-redux uses `react-intl` from the [`formatjs`](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs) library for internationalization.
Both `react-intl` and `formatjs` take advantage of native internationalization features provided by web browsers.

Language-specific content is located in YML files under the `i18n` folder
(e.g. `en-US.yml` for American English, `fr.yml` for generic French, etc.).

Most textual content can also be customized using the `language` section of `config.yml`,
whether for all languages at once or for each supported individual language.

## Library Documentation

More coming soon...

As of version 2.0, otp-react-redux utilizes React's context API in a number of components. This changed the way that some components receive props such that they will not work properly unless wrapped with the context provider used in the `ResponsiveWebapp` component.
